# Tourist Destination Selector

This project is a professional UI built using ReactJS and Tailwind CSS. The website showcases various tourist destination places with images, descriptions, and pricing. Users can confirm their destination or indicate disinterest in specific places. If all places are removed, a refresh button appears to reset the list.

# Features

- **Responsive Layout**: The layout is fully responsive and adapts to different screen sizes.
- **Hover Effects**: Interactive hover effects are applied to the cards and buttons to enhance user experience.
- **Read More Button**: Descriptions can be expanded or collapsed with a "Read More" button.
- **Selection and Removal**: Users can confirm a destination to view only that card or remove cards they are not interested in.
- **Refresh Functionality**: If all cards are removed, a refresh button allows users to reset the list.
